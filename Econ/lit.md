This paper explores the reasons a central government would give power to lower levels of government. They use Fiscal Decentralization, Lut Administrative and Political decentralization to describe the model. The paper focuses on Columbia; this is not a very quantitative paper.


UNFPA and Government Decentralization: A Study of Country Experiences

This paper does a good job defining the types of decentralization and the type that each country has. They also outline some of the problems with decentralization.


UNFPA and Government Decentralization: A Study of Country Experiences
Office of Oversight and Evaluation
United Nations Population Fund June 2000

This paper focuses on the act of becoming more decentralized using case studies from developing nations. The independent variable here is primarily healthcare related. The article is not very relevant.


The effects of Fiscal Decentralization on the Size of Government: A Meta-Analysis
Ryan Yeung
Public Financial Publications, 2009

This paper uses a multilevel model exploring publications on the relationship between decentralization and government size. The results vary primarily based on what kind of measure of decentralization was used and the scale (intra country etc.) THe most consistent results were found when fragmentation was the measure of decentralization.


Fiscal Decentralization and Deficits: International Evidence
Bilin Neyapti
Department of Economics, Bilkent University January 2010

This paper demonstrates that fiscal decentralization reduces budget deficits. SS, defense spending are removed to prevent bias. They reference a Kaufmann paper that explains how to add a proxy variable to account for the other factors measured by the UGI data; corruption, accountability, population etc. Both revenue and expenditure as measures of fiscal decentralization were used, giving consistent results. They tested correcting for grants, but the effect was usually not significant.


Explaining Fiscal Decentralization 
Leonardo Letelier S.
University of CHile 2005

This paper explores the causes for fiscal decentralization and makes thurough, economically sound arguments for the effects of income, population density/diversity, urbanization, and grants. They do an impressive job explaining why the studies had such conflicting results. The proxies used for decentralization are typically the breakdown between either revenue or expenditure between the substantial governments in the country. Data is gathered from the IMF. Excellent definitions of variables in the appendix.
